# Here is some information about me! 
My name is Aarush Tandon, I am a sophomore at Chatsworth, and I look forward to learning a lot in this class! I enjoy solving the Rubik's cube (although back in 7th grade I knew a lot more puzzles), and I enjoy learning new things. 

I am a huge fan of Transformers and the Jurassic franchise, as I grew up watching Transformers and dinosaur related shows and movies. Out of all, my favorite movies are Transformers One, Jurassic Park, and Jurassic Park III. I enjoyed them because of their plots and the action was amazing. 

Over the summer, I went to India to visit family, and I finally got to see the Taj Mahal for the first time in person. It was extremely beautiful, and the history behind it is fun to learn. Additionally, we visited the Agra Fort to see how the Mughals ruled their part of India during their time.
